/* Name: Nicholas Rosati
 * Program name: HSI266 Lab 4
 * Date: 2025-02-05
 * Purpose: The program runs for 30 seconds then quits. It will wait for user input on buttons connected to AIN0, AIN1, AIN2.
 *          When a button is pressed, the program will output to the console that the button is pressed and the associated LED state,
 *          at a rate of 10 updates/second.
 *          When button 1 is pressed, the red LED will turn on. When it is released it will turn off.
 *          When button 2 is pressed, the blue LED turns off and the amber one turns on. When it is released, the LEDs turn on and off respectively.
 *          When button 3 is pressed, the buzzer will turn on. When it is released it will turn off.
