read the labjack serial number into ljsn and print to console
set up a pwm signal on [INSERT PIN HERE]: 8bit TM, 1MHz/div TCB, 78 div

    if (IR sensor is triggered and servoCounter == 0)
        set servoCounter to 30
        move the servo to the 90 degree position
        write to the HTML file the current date, time, and that the lid was opened

    if (loopCounter % 10 == 0)
        print the state of the lid to the console

    increment loopCounter and sleep(100)

    read the state of the IR sensor into irSensor
    read the state of the rolling ball sensor into rbSensor
while (rolling ball sensor is low)
